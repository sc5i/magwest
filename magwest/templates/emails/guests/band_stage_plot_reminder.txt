{{ guest.group.name }},

In order to prepare for your performance at this upcoming {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, we need you to upload an exact description of your desired stage layout, which you can do at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/guests/stage_plot?guest_id={{ guest.id }}

An "exact description" should include for each piece of equipment to go on stage:
  - If the act intends to supply it, or if the act is requesting the equipment from backline,
  - The type (e.g., 3.5" stereo jack, RCA plug, XLR) and count of each input to be connected to the house mixer
  - The position/orientation of the equipment

Remember to indicate mic stands and monitors. A mic'ed drum kit will be provided as backline, and may remain on stage even for acts that do not make use of it.

Additionally, please also indicate if you have a visualist, or plan to be providing visuals (e.g. on a USB key, google drive link, via HDMI on stage, etc.) in the plot

The plot can be supplied as a PDF, a drawing you've taken a photo of & upload the photo, google slides (put a link into a text document & upload), PowerPoint etc.

You might check out https://tecrider.com/ to create the stage plot.

Failure to provide exact stage directions may result in you not receiving the setup you expect or want.  Please provide this description no later than {{ c.BAND_STAGE_PLOT_DEADLINE|datetime_local }}.

If you have any questions, please reach out in the MAGWest 2024 - Music Booking discord, under your private channel, or reply to this email.
